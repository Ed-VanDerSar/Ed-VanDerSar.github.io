## Welcome.

I am __Edwin Anzures__. I am interested in mathematics, programming, and the computational implementation of mathematical models. During my years of education, I had the opportunity to fully engage in the study of highly abstract yet applicable mathematics. For instance, I worked on topics such as Partial Differential Equations, Probability, and Stochastic Processes. 

I consider myself a well-read person, but I am always looking for something new outside my comfort zone. I hold self-imposed high-quality standards in multiple dimensions of my life.
