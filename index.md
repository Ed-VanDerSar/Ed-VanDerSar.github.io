I am interested in mathematics, programming, and the computational implementation of mathematical models. During my years of education, I had the opportunity to fully engage in the study of highly abstract yet applicable mathematics. For instance, I worked on topics such as Partial Differential Equations, computational implementation of the Finite Element Method for differential equations, Probability, and Stochastic Processes. 
I consider myself a well-read person, but I. am always looking for something new outside my comfort zone. I hold self-imposed high-quality standards in multiple dimensions of my life.
A consequence of my passion for studying and understanding abtsract mathematics is that I can  easily communicate complex ideas. This, combined with my experience in college education, enables me to excel in a teaching role.
Despite my academic background and focus on higher education, I am highly interested in immersing myself in non-academic projects where I can apply my mathematical and programming knowledge.
