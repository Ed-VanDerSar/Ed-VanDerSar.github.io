## Welcome.

I am __Edwin Anzures__. I am interested in mathematics, programming, and the computational implementation of mathematical models. 

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree in Applied Mathematics. My research is centered around applying probability theory to solve problems in biology. I am particularly interested in how probability models can help understand biological processes and phenomena, for instance: genetic variation, population dynamics, and the spread of mutations.

### Scientific interests:
- Mathematical biology: population dynamics and ecology
    - Coalescent and Branching Processes
    - Phase-type theory
- PDEs arising form probability theory and stochastic process
- Stochastic PDE's applied to biology and finance
